# Cookie-Editor
[Cookie-Editor](https://cookie-editor.com/) is a browser extension/add-on that lets you efficiently create, edit and delete cookies for the current tab. Perfect for developing, quickly testing or even manually managing your cookies for your privacy.

## Description
Cookie-Editor is designed to have a simple to use interface that let you do most standard cookie operations quickly. It is ideal for developing and testing web pages.

You can easily create, edit and delete a cookie for the current page that you are visiting.
There is also a handy button to mass delete all the cookies for the current page.

Cookie-Editor is available for Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and Opera. It should be possible to install it on any webkit browser, but keep in mind that only the previous four browsers are officially supported.

Cookie-Editor is available on Firefox for Android and Safari for iOS, with an interface optimised for touchscreens.
